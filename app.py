--- Personalized Diet Plan for Diabetes & Obesity ---

**Goal:** Control both blood sugar and caloric intake for healthy weight loss.
Your estimated daily calorie goal for a healthy weight loss is **{calories}** calories.

* **Low Glycemic Index Carbs:** Prioritize complex carbs that don't spike blood sugar, such as whole grains, legumes, and most vegetables.
* **Lean Protein & Healthy Fats:** These promote fullness and support weight management without negatively impacting blood sugar.
* **No Sugary Drinks:** Eliminate all sugary beverages and refined snacks, as they contribute to both weight gain and blood sugar fluctuations.
""",
            'DIABETES': """
--- Your Personalized Diabetes Management Plan ---

**Goal:** Our primary goal is to help you stabilize your blood sugar levels and feel more energized throughout the day. This plan focuses on balancing your meals to prevent sharp glucose spikes and crashes.

* **Carbohydrates:** Think "complex, not simple." Focus on high-fiber carbs like whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, oats), legumes, and vegetables. These are digested slowly, providing steady energy. Let's minimize refined grains (white bread, pasta) and all sugary drinks.
* **Protein:** Let's make protein a star in every meal. Lean protein from sources like chicken, fish, tofu, and beans will help you feel full and manage your blood sugar effectively.
* **Healthy Fats:** Good fats are your friends! Incorporate healthy fats from avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil to support heart health and satiety.
* **Meal Timing:** Let's aim for consistent meal times. Regular meals help regulate insulin and prevent extreme blood sugar fluctuations.
""",
            'HYPERTENSION': """
--- Your Personalized Hypertension Management Plan ---

**Goal:** Our main focus here is to lower your blood pressure. The key to this is managing your sodium intake and boosting foods that naturally support healthy blood flow.

* **Sodium Control:** Let's become "salt detectives." The goal is to reduce processed foods, fast food, and canned goods, which are often hidden sources of sodium. Instead of salt, let's explore a world of flavor with herbs, spices, lemon juice, and vinegar.
* **Potassium Power:** Potassium is a crucial mineral for balancing sodium levels. We'll increase your intake of potassium-rich foods like bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes.
* **Fiber:** Fiber is your ally! Foods rich in fiber, such as whole grains and vegetables, help support a healthy circulatory system.
* **Hydration:** Staying well-hydrated is essential. Let's focus on drinking plenty of water and unsweetened beverages.
""",
            'OBESITY': """
--- Your Personalized Weight Management Plan ---

**Goal:** Our plan is to create a healthy caloric deficit that leads to sustainable weight loss. This isn't about restriction; it's about nourishing your body with nutrient-dense foods to feel full and energized.
Your estimated daily calorie goal for a healthy weight loss is **{calories}** calories.

* **Calorie-Density:** Let's choose foods that are big in volume but low in calories. Think leafy greens, high-fiber vegetables, and lean proteins. These foods fill you up without adding unnecessary calories.
* **Protein:** We'll ensure every meal contains a source of lean protein. Protein helps curb cravings and preserves muscle mass as you lose weight.
* **Fiber:** Fiber is key to feeling full for longer. We'll add plenty of high-fiber foods to your meals to aid digestion and manage hunger.
* **Sugars:** Let's replace sugary drinks, sweets, and refined snacks with healthier options like whole fruits, which provide natural sweetness and fiber.

--- General Healthy Diet Plan ---

**Goal:** This plan is your guide to maintaining good health and preventing future disease. It's about balance, variety, and mindful eating.

* **Balanced Meals:** Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
* **Portion Control:** Eat mindfully and listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues.
* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water.
